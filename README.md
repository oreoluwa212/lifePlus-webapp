## LifePlus AOB+ WEB APP FLOWS.
Pulling: 
+ Clone or pull from the main branch
Adding:
+ Make sure your code is properly formatted before you commit it.
Committing: 
+ When committing, the format for adding a feature is = git commit -m ‘feature: I implemented the login screen designs.’  
+ For fixes, the format is = git commit -m ‘fix: I fixed malfunctioning of the login flow.’  
Pushing:
+ Make sure you are on your branch before you push.
+ Always push to your branch.
+ The branch “dev” is for compiling our work and seeing how it looks before we push to the main which will be connected to our hosting platform.
+ Again, DO NOT PUSH TO MAIN.
CODE.
+ Study the way the folders are arranged before starting work.
+ Ensure to make use of *React icons*, not Font Awesome
+ Export all images as SVG.
+ Study how I imported and used the image, so we won’t have much conflict when merging.
+ All reusable components like the header, sidebar, and navbar should be in the component folder.
+ All pages like the Dashboard and Settings pages should be in the Pages folder.
+ Name your pages, variables, etc. very well and distinctively to avoid mix-up.
+ I’ll send all the other things to the WhatsApp group.
# HAPPY CODING!!!
